# NETHUB

### This is one of my very first vue projects.
This application is a "new tab"-page or internet homepage. It's a tile-based site, where you select what modules you want included. Tiles and their metadata is stored in localstorage in the browser.

# Use with Vue:

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
npm run serve
```

### Compiles and minifies for production
```
npm run build
```
